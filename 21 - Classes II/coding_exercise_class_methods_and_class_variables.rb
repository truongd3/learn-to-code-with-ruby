# Define a SushiLunchOrder class below.
#
# A SushiLunchOrder object should initialize with @salmon, @tuna,
# and @yellowtail instance variables from arguments to the
# initialize method. All values will be integers representing
# the number of that type of fish in the lunch order.
#
# Define getter methods for the 3 instance variables.
#
# Define a salmon_special class method that instantiates a
# SushiLunchOrder instance with 6 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces
# of tuna, and 3 pieces of yellowtail.
#
# Define a family_combo class method that instantiates a
# SushiLunchOrder instance with 12 pieces of salmon, 12 pieces
# of tuna, and 12 pieces of yellowtail.
#
# Define a total_pieces class variable that keeps track of
# the TOTAL number of pieces of fish that have been sold.
# This is not the number of SushiLunchOrder instances but rather
# the sum of all the parts of fish.
#
# Define a total_pieces class method that exposes the value of
# the total_pieces class variable.
#
# EXAMPLE
# order1 = SushiLunchOrder.salmon_special
# p order1.salmon     # 6
# p order1.tuna       # 3
# p order1.yellowtail # 3
# p SushiLunchOrder.total_pieces # 12

# order2 = SushiLunchOrder.family_combo
# p order2.salmon     # 12
# p order2.tuna       # 12
# p order2.yellowtail # 12
# p SushiLunchOrder.total_pieces # 48

# order3 = SushiLunchOrder.new(3, 4, 5)
# p order3.salmon     # 3
# p order3.tuna       # 4
# p order3.yellowtail # 5
